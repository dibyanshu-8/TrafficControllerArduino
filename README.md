# TrafficControllerArduino
A small project on "Traffic control" using Arduino by Tinkercad software.The code simulates a traffic light by sequentially turning on and off the red, yellow, and green LEDs using specified timings. The red light stays on for the longest duration, followed by a flashing yellow period, and then the green light. This repeats continuously.
