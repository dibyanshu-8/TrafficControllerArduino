# TrafficControllerArduino
A small project on "Traffic control" using Arduino by Tinkercad software.The code simulates a traffic light by sequentially turning on and off the red, yellow, and green LEDs using specified timings. The red light stays on for the longest duration, followed by a flashing yellow period, and then the green light. This repeats continuously.

Procedure:-
1)connect the GND pin (Negative Pin) of all led to Pin GND of Arduino with resistors in series.
2)Connect Red LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin) to assigned pin in code(6) of Arduino.
3)Connect Yellow LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin) to assigned pin in code(8) of Arduino.
4)Connect Green LED VCC Pin (Positive Pin) to assigned pin in code(9) of Arduino.
